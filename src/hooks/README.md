# src/hooks

Purpose: Custom React hooks (`useXxx`) that encapsulate shared stateful logic.

Notes:
- Keep hooks focused and reusable.
- Avoid placing UI components here.

Agent commands:
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build` (copies `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html`)
- `npm run preview`
