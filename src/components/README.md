# src/components

Purpose: Reusable UI components and feature-specific building blocks for the app.

Notes:
- Keep generic UI primitives in `ui/`.
- Group feature components in subfolders (e.g. `scores/`, `auth/`).

Agent commands:
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build` (copies `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html`)
- `npm run preview`
